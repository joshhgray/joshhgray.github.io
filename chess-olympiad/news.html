It was close in the final few rounds, and with equal match points to Armenia, Uzbekistan narrowly won gold by tie breaks. This marks Uzbekistan’s first medal since 1992 where they won silver to the dominant Garry Kasparov and Team Russia.<p>Team Uzbekistan ended the tournament with 19 match points, equal to Team Armenia. However, thanks to the individual performances by Team Uzbekistan’s players, Uzbekistan won the tournament by tie-breaks. Nodirbek Abdusattorov played board one for the full 11 rounds winning an impressive seven games, drawing three, and losing only one, to Pentala Harikrishna. On board two Nodirbek Yakubboev also played for the full 11 rounds, winning five games, drawing six and not losing a single game. Javokhir Sindarov played 10 rounds on board three winning five games, drawing three and losing two. Jakhongir Vakhidov played one game on board three and seven on board four, winning five games, drawing three, all without dropping a match. In reserve Uzbekistan had Shamsiddin Vokhidov, who also didn’t lose any of his four matches, winning three and drawing one.<p>The team ended the tournament with an astounding 25 victories on the board. What’s more impressive is how young the team is. Jovokhir Sindarov is just 16 years old, Abdusattorov 17, Vokhidov and Yakubboev 20, and the oldest Vakhidov is 28. Vokhidov notably beat Magnus Carlsen during the 2018 World Rapid Chess Championship back in 2018 at age 16. Last year Abdusattorov won the same tournament at age 17 becoming the youngest player to do so. These young players might not yet be super GMs but they’re definitely names you should watch out for in the future.</div><div class="news-card news-card2"><figure><div class="news-card-photo news2"></div><figcaption>Magnus Carlsen</figcaption></figure><h2 class=card-head>Magnus Forfeits World Championship Title</h2><p>In 2013 Magnus Carlsen secured his first FIDE World Championship title beating 5 time World Champion Viswanathan Anand. Last year in 2021 Magnus defended his title, winning his own 5th World Championship event. Although his opponent Ian Nepomniachtchi played some formidable chess, Magnus made this matchup look easy. Magnus won 4 games and tied 7 to win the championship in just 11 of the 14 possible games.<p>After winning the World Championship title again, Magnus stated publicly that it was possible he wouldn’t play for the next championship title. Many thought this was an empty statement and that there was no doubt Magnus, one of the greatest chess players of all time, would give up his opportunity to continue his domination in the World Championship. However, following this year’s FIDE Candidates Tournament where Ian Nepomniatchi secured his spot as Magnus’ challenger, Magnus went public confirming that he would not be playing in the 2023 World Chess Championship.<p>With Magnus out of the Tournament, Ian will be competing against Candidates runner-up Ding Liren. Nepomniatchi is currently world rank number 3 and Liren is number 2. Liren, who wasn’t even expected to play in the candidates despite his incredibly high ranking, had a grueling road to this position. Earlier this year Sergey Karjakin was banned from competitive chess, leaving a spot open. FIDE regulation 2.3 states “If any replacement is needed, the highest-rated player in the FIDE May 2022 standard rating list shall be invited, provided he/she has at least 30 standard games rated in the FIDE rating list from June 2021 to May 2022.”(FIDE, 2022). Ding had not played much competitive chess since Covid-19 lockdowns began due to traveling in and out of his home country China being too difficult. But after Karjakin was banned Ding seized on the opportunity, playing 28 games in his home country in order to qualify as the substitute.<p>Liren and Team China as well as Nepomniatchi and Team Russia won’t be participating in this year's chess olympiad but we’ll see these two players next year for what’s bound to be an entertaining World Championship match as a new Champion is crowned for the first time in 10 years.<p>Magnus will continue to compete, with no plans to retire from the game just yet. Despite being the highest ranked player of all time, he still seeks the elusive 2900 rating. A level many familiar with the game are saying is impossible. It's the goal Magnus needs however to continue to have motivation in the sport he is so dominant in.<p>Despite having the greatest living chess player on their team, Team Norway didn’t fare well in the tournament. The team finished in an unimpressive 59th place. Magnus played in all but the first and last games, winning 6 and drawing 3. The team lost pairings in which the odds were heavily in their favor. Team Norway may not have done so well this year, but there’s no doubt that Magnus is still at the top of his game with 2900 still in his sights.</div><div class=news-card><figure><div class="news-card-photo news3"></div><figcaption>Dommaraju “Gukesh D” Gukesh</figcaption></figure><h2 class=card-head>Gukesh D Unstopable</h2><p>8 for 8 to start the tournament, Dommaraju “Gukesh D” Gukesh was unstoppable even in the face of the world’s greats. Gukesh began the year with a 2614 rating, at only 15 years old. He became one of the youngest grandmasters of all time just 3 years prior at age 12. Now, 9 rounds into the tournament he boasts a 2723 classical rating, putting himself at number 25 in the world.<p>India’s B-team has proved themselves, hosting some of the youngest players in the tournament Praggnanandhaa “Pragg” Rameshbabu, Raunak Sadhwani and Gukesh, all 16 as well as Nihal Sarin, just 18. They haven’t let their lack of experience (compared to the other teams) falter them. Now, 9 out of 11 rounds into the tournament India 2 is in second place, narrowly behind Uzbekistan.<p>Not even Fabiano Caruana, world rank number five to start the tournament, could stop Gukesh. Caruana seems to have been having a rough couple years, falling out of the 2800s. It’s clear he isn’t at his previous form. Caruana has been getting aggressive in some of his games, going for wins where many other contenders would be trying for a draw. Gukesh took full advantage of this, beating his highest rated opponent this tournament and further proving himself. In 45 moves, Gukesh handed Fabiano his third loss of the tournament.<p>It took 9 rounds for someone to even draw against Gukesh. It was none other than Azerbaijan’s Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, ranked number 10 in the world. It was an aggressive game which saw Gukesh offering a queen trade on move seven. Mamedyarov would accept and after a very quick simplification, the players agreed to a draw on move 34.<p>This young team looks to prove themselves further in the next two rounds. They’ll have to beat Uzbekistan tomorrow, currently number 1 in the standings. Can the hometown heroes pull through in the final moments of the tournament? We’ll find out soon.</div><div class=news-card><figure><div class="news-card-photo news4"></div><figcaption>Oliwia Kiolbasa</figcaption></figure><h2 class=card-head>Notable Performances</h2><div class=notables-div><table class=notables-table><tr class=notables-column-header><th>Board<th>Open (W-D-L)<th>Womens (W-D-L)<tr><td>1<td><img alt="India flag"src=assets/flags/india.png height=20 width=30>Gukesh, D (8-2-1)<td><img alt="Norway flag"src=assets/flags/norway.png height=20 width=30>Crammling, Pia (8-3-0)<tr><td>2<td><img alt="India flag"src=assets/flags/india.png height=20 width=30>Nihal Sarin (5-5-0)<td><img alt="Georgia flag"src=assets/flags/georgia.png height=20 width=30>Batsiashvili, Nino (6-3-1)<tr><td>3<td><img alt="England flag"src=assets/flags/england.png height=20 width=30>Howell, David (7-1-0)<td><img alt="Poland flag"src=assets/flags/poland.png height=20 width=30>Kiolbasa, Oliwia (9-1-1)<tr><td>4<td><img alt="Uzbekistan flag"src=assets/flags/uzbekistan.png height=20 width=30>Vakhidov, Jakhongir (5-3-0)<td><img alt="Mongolia flag"src=assets/flags/mongolia.png height=20 width=30>Mungunzul, Bat-Erdene (8-1-1)</table></div></div><div class=news-card><figure><div class="news-card-photo news5"></div><figcaption>Chinese and Russian Flags</figcaption></figure><h2 class=card-head>Russia and China Absent From This Years Olympiad</h2><p>Russia and China, both with a history of success in the Olympiad will be absent from the tournament this year.
