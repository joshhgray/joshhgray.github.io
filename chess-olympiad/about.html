The International Chess Federation or FIDE would be formed at the end of that tournament. 3 years later the first official Chess Olympiad would take place in London, England. Of the 44 Chess Olympiads the Soviet Union has won 18 gold medals, Russia has an additional 6. The next closest team is The United States with 6 gold. Some of the greatest chess players of all time have competed in the olympiad, including: Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov and Bobby Fischer.<h2>The Format:</h2><p>The 2022 Chess Olympiad will be split into 2 sections, Open and Women’s. Nearly all countries will be competing this year. There will be 11 rounds and since there are over 180 countries, obviously not each team will be able to face each other. Thus, a swiss-system will be used. Swiss-systems are designed so that teams of similar levels are paired against each other. Pairings will be updated after each round. Teams will not play each other twice. There are 6 members per team, one captain, four players and one reserve player. The captain is also able to play if needed. Teams choose four members to sit at boards 1-4 (usually in order of skill level, so that higher ranking members of each team play each other). Time control will be 90+30 which means the players have 90 minutes to make 40 moves at which point 30 minutes will be added to the clock. Additionally, draws by agreement aren’t allowed until after move 30. On each individual board, a win equals 1 point, a draw 0.5, and a loss 0. If a team wins their pairing they receive 2 match points, a draw means 1 point, and a loss means 0. Tie break points are calculated based on individual points.</div><div class="about-card about-card3"><h1>Chennai, India</h1><p>Chennai, formerly known as Madras is a coastal city off the east coast of India.
